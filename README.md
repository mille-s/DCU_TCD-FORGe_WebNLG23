# DCU_TCD-FORGe_WebNLG23

Notes:

1. Even though we use the same resources in this repository, the outputs can sometimes be slightly different from the outputs submitted at WebNLG, because of some clashing rules (e.g. the same attributes is assigned two different value and which one is kept is random) or some built-in non-determinism (e.g. the aggregation rules may apply differently because some are triggered by random values, or some orders between adverbials are not specified and are chosen randomly).
2. Running FORGe on Colab is slower than locally, and the time taken for generation can vary significantly (possibly according to the assigned CPU)....
